## üöÄ About the Project

**CS102x Game Project** is a challenging, large-scale, single-player platformer, fully playable in your terminal and crafted entirely in C++. You'll jump, climb, shoot, and strategize your way through a massive ASCII world packed with hazards, secrets, and epic boss battles.

> **"A nostalgic adventure where code meets creativity, and every frame is hand-drawn with ASCII art."**

## üéÆ Gameplay Overview

- **Explore** a vast, scrollable ASCII map filled with platforms, elevators, ladders, traps, and secrets.
- **Collect** 10 coins to unlock the mysterious teleporter and gain access to the final boss area.

## üß† Analysis & Design Highlights

- **Pure C++** ‚Äì No graphics libraries, no dependencies; just logic, arrays, and ASCII.
- **Game Loop** ‚Äì Custom handling for player input, enemy AI, and real-time rendering using efficient in-place terminal redraws.
- **Stateful Entities** ‚Äì All objects (player, enemies, coins, hearts, elevators) are structured for easy extension.
- **Collision System** ‚Äì Custom hitboxes and detection for both player and enemy interactions.
- **Scalability** ‚Äì The game world is much larger than the visible screen, with active scrolling and "camera" logic.
- **User-Friendly** ‚Äì Main menu, instructions, credits, and win/lose screens for a polished arcade feel.

## üèóÔ∏è How to Build and Run

### Requirements

- **C++ Compiler:** Any modern compiler supporting C++11 or later (e.g., g++, clang, MSVC)
- **Operating System:** Windows (recommended for `<conio.h>` support); Linux requires minor code tweaks for input.
- **Terminal:** At least 80x24 characters.

### Build (Windows Example)

```sh
g++ -o cs102x_game Game.cpp
```

### Run

```sh
./cs102x_game
```

> **Note:**  
> On Linux/Mac, replace `<conio.h>`, `_getch()`, and `_kbhit()` with equivalents (see [this resource](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7469139/what-is-equivalent-to-getch-getche-in-linux)).
